# PRD Requirements Review & MySQL Database Verification Checklist

## 🎯 **Overview**

This comprehensive checklist ensures all Product Requirements Document (PRD) features are implemented and working correctly with the MySQL database schema. Based on the PRD analysis, this covers 12 major categories with 60+ specific verification tasks.

## 🚨 **Critical Priority Items**

### **MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION:**
1. **Remove Hardcoded Status Values** - Backend has hardcoded status arrays instead of database queries
2. **Fix Database Connection Issues** - Ensure MySQL connection works and status_configuration table has data  
3. **Verify Dynamic Status Loading** - Test all status configurations load from database, not hardcoded
4. **Email Notifications** - Currently not implemented but required by PRD

## 📊 **Current Implementation Status**

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Database & Infrastructure | ⚠️ Partial | MySQL connection issues |
| Authentication & User Management | ✅ Complete | None |
| Activity Management | ⚠️ Partial | Hardcoded status values |
| Task Board System | ✅ Complete | Status hardcoding |
| Reporting & Analytics | ✅ Complete | None |
| Security & Compliance | ✅ Complete | None |
| Performance & Scalability | ❓ Untested | Need load testing |
| User Experience & Accessibility | ✅ Complete | None |
| Email Notifications | ❌ Missing | Not implemented |

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **IMMEDIATE (Priority 1)**: Fix hardcoded status values in backend
2. **IMMEDIATE (Priority 1)**: Ensure MySQL database connection works
3. **HIGH (Priority 2)**: Implement email notification system
4. **MEDIUM (Priority 3)**: Conduct performance and load testing
5. **LOW (Priority 4)**: Complete accessibility and UX testing

## 📝 **Notes**

- PRD specifies PostgreSQL but implementation uses MySQL (acceptable deviation)
- Architecture is excellent with proper separation of concerns
- Frontend is well-architected with centralized configuration
- Main blocker is backend hardcoding issues preventing dynamic status management
