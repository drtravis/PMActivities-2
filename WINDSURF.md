# Windsurf Development Guide - PMActivities 2

## 🌊 **Windsurf Branch Overview**

The `windsurf` branch is your dedicated development environment for Windsurf IDE work. It's completely isolated from production and provides a safe space for experimentation and development.

## 🛡️ **Safety First**

### **100% Safe Operations**:
- ✅ Working on `windsurf` branch
- ✅ Local development with `npm run dev`
- ✅ Committing to `windsurf` branch
- ✅ Creating feature branches from `windsurf`
- ✅ Testing locally at http://localhost:3000

### **Will NOT Trigger Deployment**:
- ✅ Any changes on `windsurf` branch
- ✅ Pushing to `origin/windsurf`
- ✅ Local testing and development

## 🚀 **Windsurf Workflow**

### **Step 1: Switch to Windsurf Branch**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "PMActivities 2"

# Switch to windsurf branch
git checkout windsurf
git pull origin windsurf

# Verify you're on the right branch
git branch  # Should show * windsurf
```

### **Step 2: Start Local Development**
```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd activity-tracker/frontend

# Start development server
npm run local:dev
# or
npm run dev

# Your local server: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 3: Make Changes in Windsurf**
- Open Windsurf IDE
- Make your changes
- Test locally at http://localhost:3000
- All changes are completely safe and isolated

### **Step 4: Save Your Work**
```bash
# Check what changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Windsurf: Add new feature/fix/improvement"

# Push to windsurf branch (safe - won't deploy)
git push origin windsurf
```

## 🔄 **Advanced Windsurf Workflows**

### **Option A: Direct Windsurf Development**
```bash
git checkout windsurf
# Work directly on windsurf branch
# Perfect for quick changes and experiments
```

### **Option B: Feature Branches from Windsurf**
```bash
git checkout windsurf
git checkout -b feature/windsurf-new-component
# Work on specific feature
# Merge back to windsurf when ready
git checkout windsurf
git merge feature/windsurf-new-component
```

### **Option C: Experimental Windsurf Work**
```bash
git checkout windsurf
git checkout -b experimental/windsurf-testing
# Try risky changes without affecting windsurf branch
```

## 🔄 **Syncing with Other Branches**

### **Get Latest from Development**:
```bash
git checkout windsurf
git merge development
# Brings development changes into windsurf
```

### **Share Windsurf Changes with Development**:
```bash
git checkout development
git merge windsurf
# Only when you want to share your windsurf work
```

## 🎯 **Testing Your Changes**

### **Local Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Homepage loads: http://localhost:3000/
- [ ] Login page works: http://localhost:3000/login
- [ ] Setup page works: http://localhost:3000/setup
- [ ] Demo page works: http://localhost:3000/demo
- [ ] Navigation buttons work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design looks good
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Animations work smoothly

### **Pre-deployment Check** (when ready):
```bash
npm run deploy:check
# Runs build + lint + validation
```

## 🚀 **When Ready to Deploy**

Only when you're completely satisfied with your windsurf changes:

### **Option 1: Merge to Development First**
```bash
git checkout development
git merge windsurf
# Test on development
# Then merge development to main when ready
```

### **Option 2: Direct to Production** (when confident)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge windsurf
git push origin main  # Triggers Azure deployment
```

## 📁 **Windsurf Branch Structure**

## 💡 **Windsurf Pro Tips**

1. **Always verify your branch**:
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Keep it organized**:
   - Use feature branches for major changes
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Test thoroughly before merging anywhere

## 🆘 **Emergency Recovery**

If something goes wrong on windsurf branch:

```bash
# Reset to last known good state
git checkout windsurf
git reset --hard origin/windsurf

# Or start fresh from development
git checkout development
git branch -D windsurf
git checkout -b windsurf
git push -u origin windsurf
```

## ✅ **Current Branch Setup**

```
main (production)           ← Auto-deploys to Azure
├── v1.0.0 (stable)        ← Frozen production version
├── development (active)    ← General development
└── windsurf (your space)   ← Your Windsurf development
```

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

Your `windsurf` branch is ready for development. You can:
